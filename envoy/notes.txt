HTTP/2Â¶
The HTTP/2 connection pool multiplexes multiple requests over a single connection, up to the limits imposed by max concurrent streams and max requests per connection. The HTTP/2 connection pool establishes as many connections as are needed to serve requests. With no limits, this will be only a single connection. If a GOAWAY frame is received or if the connection reaches the maximum requests per connection limit, the connection pool will drain the affected connection. Once a connection reaches its maximum concurrent stream limit, it will be marked as busy until a stream is available. New connections are established anytime there is a pending request without a connection that can be dispatched to (up to circuit breaker limits for connections). HTTP/2 is the preferred communication protocol when Envoy is operating as a reverse proxy, as connections rarely, if ever, get severed.
